## Project
StudyCards is android application for learning foreign words, idioms by cards and images.With the help of our program, you can easily memorize words and train at any convenient time.For example, if you take other similar programs for memorizing new foreign words, then in many respects they work only online, the advantages of our program are precisely that it will work offline, the ability to save new words to a selection and later study them both online and in offline mode. It will also be possible to save and translate new words from subtitles, unfamiliar words from newspapers and magazines, as well as books.

- Main/Home page
- User profile
- List of all unknown/uncertain/known words
- Page for creating new word
- Page for creating new folder 
- Buy product(app in purchase)
- Page with 4 games.


## Goals
* We want to create a mobile application that will help users improve their skills in memorizing foreign words and phrases.
* We focused on developing learning modules with clear controls and direct evidence of progress. Another aspect that we take into account is the integration of the game component to increase the attractiveness of learning.
* We think that in childhood, many of us heard from our teachers and parents that we need to learn foreign languages, that this will come in handy in the future. Most of us did not listen to their words, and did not pay attention.
Now, when they are growing up, they understand that there are many pluses than minuses in the knowledge of foreign languages. Therefore, we hope that our application will help such people in learning a new foreign language.
